            <b>What is DSC and how does it work?</b>
            <br><br>
            <p>A digital certificate is an electronic document issued by (CA) and all the CA's are controlled by CCA's.
                <br>
                It contains the public key for a Digital Signature and specifies the identity associated with the key, such as the name of an organization or individual.
                <br>
                The certificate is used to confirm that the public key belongs to a specific organization or individual.</p>
            <br><br>

            <b>What is DSC?</b>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Digital Signature Certificates (DSC) are the digital equivalent (that is electronic format) of physical or paper certificates. Few Examples of physical certificates are drivers' licenses, passports or membership cards.</li>
                <li>A Digital Signature Certificate authenticates your identity electronically and it follows end to end encryption using Asymmetric keys (Public key for encryption and private key for decryption).</li>
	            <li>Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) is the electronic format of a physical or paper certificate. DSC serves as proof of identity of an individual or Organization for a certain purpose online / on computer. DSC authenticates and electronic document like how a handwritten signature authenticates a printed / handwritten document. DSC can be used to E-Verify returns filed by a taxpayer and is also mandatory in some cases.</li>
	            <li>A DSC contains information about the user’s name, pin code, country, email address, date of issuance of certificate and name of the certifying authority. The DSCs are usually valid for one, two, Three years. However, they can be renewed before the expiry period.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>Who needs DSC?</b>
                <li style="list-style-type: none;">DSC is mandatory for some services / user categories such as e-Verification of returns filed by companies and political parties as well as other persons whose accounts are required to be audited under Section 44AB of the Income Tax Act. (In other cases, it is optional)</li>
            <br>
            <b>Advantages of DSC?</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Authentication:</b> Helpful in authenticating the personal information details of the individual holder when conducting business online.</li>
                <li><b>Reduced cost and time:</b> Instead of signing the hard copy documents physically and scanning them to send them via e-mail, you can digitally sign the PDF files and send them much more quickly. A DSC holder does not have to be physically present to conduct or authorize a business.</li>
                <li><b>Data integrity:</b> Documents that are signed digitally cannot be altered or edited after signing, which makes the data safe and secure. Government agencies often ask for these certificates to cross-check and verify the business transaction.</li>
                <li><b>Authenticity of Documents:</b> Digital Signature documents give the confidence to the receiver to be assured of the signer’s authenticity. They Can Take Action on the basis of Such Documents Without getting Worried about the documents being forged.</li>
